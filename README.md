Software Engineering and Security Research<br>
This means I have an interest in writing code and program analysis, but a lot of my writeups are not public because I would like to make sure pwn.college stays a valid learning platform
## Practicing Security Research
These are my favorite places to practice my security skills
- https://github.com/guyinatuxedo/nightmare<br>
This is where I learn and practice my binary exploitation skills
- https://pwn.college/<br>
This is where I learn and practice my binary exploitation skills
- https://ost2.fyi/<br>
This is where I learn about all kinds of security research topics
- https://portswigger.net/web-security<br>
This is all about web security vulns, but I don't have a ton of time to practice on it
## Software Development
Most of my best work is listed in my favorited repositories, but I have done an open source contribution where I patched a piece of firmware
## Work History
I have some work experience
- I did about three months of an internship doing embedded development with arduinos
- I also spent about a year doing malware analysis with volatility, and building memory forensics training materials
