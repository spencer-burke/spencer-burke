Software Engineering and Security Research<br>
This means I have an interest in writing code and program analysis, but a lot of my writeups are not public because I would like to make sure pwn.college stays a valid learning platform
## Software Development
Most of my best work is listed in my favorited repositories, but I have done an open source contribution where I patched a piece of firmware
## Work History
I have some work experience
- I did about three months of an internship doing embedded development with arduinos
- I also spent about a year doing malware analysis with volatility, and building memory forensics training materials
