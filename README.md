Software Engineering and Security Research
This means I have an interest in writing code and program analysis
## Practicing Security Research
These are my favorite places to practice my security skills
- https://pwn.college/
This is where I learn and practice my binary exploitation skills
- https://ost2.fyi/
This is where I learn about all kinds of security research topics
- https://portswigger.net/web-security
This is all about web security vulns, but I don't have a ton of time to practice on it
## Software Development
Most of my best work is listed in my favorited repositories, but I have done an open source contribution where I patched a piece of firmware
